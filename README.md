Enzymes 

Enzymes are proteins that catalyse biochemical reactions. They remain unchanged after each reaction.

Specificity of enzymes
All enzymes have a specific active site, which is complementary to only one substrate. Thus, only one type of molecule can bind to the enzyme to form an enzyme-substrate complex

Reusability of enzymes 
The enzymes are not part of the reaction that they catalyse. Thus, only a small amount of enzymes are needed to catalyse a large number of substrate molecules.

Effect of Temperature on Enzymatic reactions 
As the surrounding temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules also increases. Thus, they collide more frequently and this increases the chance of them coming into contact with the enzymes active site. The enzymes catalyse substrate at a higher rate, specifically, for every 10deg Celsius increase in temperature, the rate of enzymatic reactions doubles. At the optimum temperature, the kinetic energy of the molecules are at the greatest and thus the rate of enzymatic reaction is at its greatest. When the temperature increases beyond the optimum temperature, the rate of enzymatic reactions decreases sharply. This is because the active site of the enzyme has changed its shape. The enzymes loses its complementarity with the substrate and the substrate molecules are not able to bind to the active site. Further increase in temperature will cause irreversible denaturation of the enzyme. 

Effect of pH on Enzymatic reactions 
At the optimum pH, the rate of enzymatic reactions is the greatest. At extreme pH values above and below the optimum temperature, the ionic bonds in the enzyme are disrupted thus causing the denaturation of the enzyme. As a result, at these extreme pH levels, the rate of the enzymatic reactions is significantly reduced as the substrate molecules are not able to bind at the active site. 

Effect of substrate concentration of Rate of Enzymatic Reactions
The rate of enzymatic reactions increases until substrate concentration reaches X. The rate then remains constant as the enzyme molecules are saturated, as the substrate molecules have occupied all the available active sites of the enzymes. 

Commercial applications of enzymes 
Meat tenderiser - protease 
Ice cream/milk - lactase which converts lactose into glucose and galactose 
Cereals - cellulase
Agar from seaweed - cellulase  
Stain removers in detergents - protease, amylase, lipase 
Biopolishing of cotton fabric - cellulase 
Transport of Substances
Diffusion 
Net movement of atoms, ions or molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, molecules move down concentration gradient, to form a homogenous environment.

Concentration gradient, temperature, and surface area through which diffusion occurs

Diffusion in Organisms 
Carbon dioxide and oxygen diffuses into AIR SPACES due to the lower concentration in the AIR SPACES

Partially permeable membrane - membrane that allows some molecules to pass through but not others.


Osmosis
Net movement of water from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential across a partially permeable membrane 

Animal cells
Hypotonic ; Water flows in, lysis 
Isotonic ;	No net movement of water, remains the same 	
Hypertonic; 	The cell becomes flaccid, water flows out 	

Plant calls 
Hypotonic: waterflows in ; turgid 
Isotonic;nonet movement of water; remains the same
Hypertonic;waterflows in ;playmolysis

Active transport 
Method of transport that moves substances against the concentration gradient 
Requires  energy in the form of ATP molecules 
In the root hair cells, Na+, Ca2+ is absorbed against the concentration gradient 

Factors affecting diffusion/ osmosis
Temperature-increase rate - more kinectic enerfy, move faster
Concentration gradient-increase rate  - moere moelecules cross over 
SA:V ratio-increase rate-more surface rae, shorter distance to travel
